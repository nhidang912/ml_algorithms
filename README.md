Original paper: Noisy Tensor Completion via Low-Rank Tensor Ring (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08857)

Scope of work: implement NTRC algorithm and test on 1 512x512 image example

Current status:
- The algorithm is able to reconstructe the image after around 200 iteration
- The reconstructed image still has a bad quality
- The optimization is not convergence

To be improve:
- ...
